# movie-recommender-system
This project presents a Movie Recommender System built in Python using the MovieLens dataset, a widely used benchmark in recommendation research. The system applies collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies to users based on their historical ratings and the preferences of other users with similar tastes.
